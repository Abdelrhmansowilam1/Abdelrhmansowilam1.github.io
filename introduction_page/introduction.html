	AIM Group is committed to helping its clients reach their goals, to personalising their event experiences, to providing an innovative environment, and to making a difference. 

	Our strong sense of identification with client projects means that we are constantly striving to provide solutions, even for issues they aren’t yet aware of. To this end, we adopt a progressive approach to technology and marketing techniques.  
	
	This sense of identification also means we value and promote seamless interaction with clients’ own teams, and ensure the best value is obtained from their event budget.  
	
	Our long experience at the top of the events business means we have expertise which reaches across a number of sectors, as well as knowledge of specific protocol and local regulations. But we know that things change, and we are constantly striving to adapt and improve. 
	
	As a consequence, we strive to share the experience we acquire across our organisation, which now extends to 16 offices around the world. With more than 25 nationalities represented – and as many languages spoken – our staff bring exceptional location knowledge to projects, as well as a deep understanding of cultural issues.
